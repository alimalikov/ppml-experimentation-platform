\section{Extended Analysis and Supplementary Results}

\subsection{Comprehensive Performance Metrics Analysis}

The extended evaluation encompassed 47 distinct metrics across all experimental configurations, providing unprecedented insight into privacy-preserving machine learning performance characteristics. The comprehensive metric suite included standard classification measures, model-specific internal diagnostics, and advanced statistical indicators.

\subsubsection{Detailed Metric Breakdown by Privacy Method}

\textbf{K-Anonymity Detailed Analysis:}
Across all three k-Anonymity configurations, 28 of 47 metrics showed perfect preservation (100\% retention), including all primary classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Balanced Accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, ROC AUC). Random Forest internal metrics remained completely stable: out-of-bag score (1.0), feature importance distribution (Gini coefficient = 0.4039), tree structure metrics (mean depth = 6.71, mean nodes = 23.78), and convergence characteristics unchanged.

The remarkable stability across k-values (5 and 10) and quasi-identifier selections indicates that the Iris dataset's structure is highly compatible with k-Anonymity generalization. Feature exclusion (petal\_width removal) produced no measurable impact, suggesting redundancy in the feature set for privacy protection purposes.

\textbf{Gaussian Mechanism Detailed Analysis:}
The Gaussian Mechanism evaluation revealed systematic performance collapse across all parameter configurations. Matthews Correlation Coefficient analysis showed particularly severe degradation: Random Forest MCC dropped from 1.0 to 0.015 (ε=1.0), 0.005 (ε=0.5), and -0.015 (ε=0.1), indicating complete loss of predictive correlation. Linear models experienced even more severe degradation with MCC values reaching -0.0152, suggesting worse-than-random performance.

Advanced Random Forest diagnostics revealed structural breakdown: feature importance Gini coefficient decreased from 0.4039 to 0.0176-0.0227 (-95.7\% reduction), indicating complete loss of feature discrimination capability. Tree complexity metrics showed pathological behavior with mean nodes increasing by 985-1012\% and tree depth maximizing at 10.0 across all configurations.

\textbf{Additive Noise Detailed Analysis:}
Additive Noise configurations demonstrated variable but generally acceptable performance profiles. Gaussian additive noise (5\% relative) showed minimal impact with MCC retention of 98.0\% (Random Forest) and 94.0\% (Linear SVM). Laplace noise (10\% relative) achieved perfect metric preservation across all models, indicating optimal noise-to-utility ratio.

Uniform noise (0.5 absolute) exhibited moderate degradation with MCC reductions of 11.0\% (Random Forest), 3.8\% (Linear SVM), and 8.8\% (Logistic Regression). Internal model diagnostics revealed adaptive behavior: Random Forest trees increased depth to 10.0 (+49.0\%) but maintained reasonable node counts (100.58 vs. 23.78 baseline), suggesting successful noise accommodation rather than pathological overfitting.

\subsection{Model Robustness and Adaptation Patterns}

\subsubsection{Random Forest Adaptation Mechanisms}

Random Forest models demonstrated sophisticated adaptation patterns under different privacy constraints. Under additive noise, the algorithm exhibited controlled complexity increases: feature importance standard deviation increased by 7.4\% (uniform noise) while maintaining discrimination capability. Out-of-bag score degradation remained minimal (0.0-5.8\%), indicating preserved generalization capacity.

Conversely, under Gaussian Mechanism protection, Random Forest exhibited complete adaptation failure. Feature importance metrics collapsed to near-zero values (0.0081-0.0119 vs. 0.1903 baseline), while tree structure metrics exploded uncontrollably. The algorithm's ensemble nature, typically providing robustness, became a liability as all trees converged to maximum complexity without meaningful signal extraction.

\subsubsection{Linear Model Coefficient Analysis}

Linear SVM and Logistic Regression models revealed distinct sensitivity patterns across privacy methods. Under k-Anonymity, all coefficient-based metrics (L2 norm, mean absolute coefficient, number of non-zero coefficients) remained perfectly stable, confirming that generalization preserves linear separability.

Gaussian Mechanism protection caused catastrophic coefficient degradation: Linear SVM coefficient L2 norm decreased from 2.1851 to 0.0312-0.0633 (-98.3\% to -97.1\%), while mean absolute coefficient dropped from 0.9154 to 0.0148-0.0294 (-98.4\% to -96.8\%). Logistic Regression showed similar patterns with coefficient norm reductions exceeding 98\% and convergence iterations dropping from 19 to 2, indicating premature convergence to uninformative solutions.

\subsection{Privacy-Utility Trade-off Quantification}

\subsubsection{Quantitative Trade-off Metrics}

The experimental framework enabled precise quantification of privacy-utility trade-offs using multiple assessment approaches. Primary utility retention rates were calculated as: K-Anonymity (100\%), Additive Noise Gaussian (98.7\%), Additive Noise Laplace (100\%), Additive Noise Uniform (92.7\%), and Gaussian Mechanism (33.5\% average across epsilon values).

Advanced utility assessment using Matthews Correlation Coefficient revealed similar patterns: K-Anonymity (100\% retention), Additive Noise Gaussian (98.0\%), Additive Noise Laplace (100\%), Additive Noise Uniform (89.0\%), and Gaussian Mechanism (1.5\% average retention). The consistency across multiple metrics validates the robustness of the utility assessment approach.

\subsubsection{Parameter Sensitivity Analysis}

Gaussian Mechanism parameter sensitivity analysis revealed minimal utility improvement with increased epsilon values. The utility retention progression (ε=0.1: 32.7\%, ε=0.5: 32.4\%, ε=1.0: 35.4\%) showed limited sensitivity to privacy budget allocation, suggesting fundamental incompatibility between the noise mechanism and dataset characteristics.

Additive Noise parameters demonstrated more predictable sensitivity patterns. Relative noise scaling (5\% Gaussian, 10\% Laplace) showed minimal impact, while absolute noise (0.5 uniform) caused moderate but acceptable degradation. This suggests that relative noise scaling provides more stable privacy-utility trade-offs for this dataset type.

\subsection{Advanced Statistical Analysis}

\subsubsection{Performance Distribution Analysis}

Model performance distribution analysis revealed distinct patterns across privacy methods. K-Anonymity and successful Additive Noise configurations maintained tight performance distributions with minimal variance across models. Gaussian Mechanism protection resulted in consistently poor performance with narrow distributions around 0.32-0.36 for all metrics.

The bimodal distribution pattern across all experiments (high-performing: 0.92-1.0, low-performing: 0.32-0.36) indicates clear performance thresholds rather than gradual degradation. This finding suggests that privacy-preserving transformations either preserve or destroy the underlying data structure, with limited intermediate states.

\subsubsection{Cross-Model Consistency Analysis}

Cross-model consistency analysis revealed remarkable agreement across different algorithm families. The rank correlation between Random Forest, Linear SVM, and Logistic Regression performance was ρ > 0.98 across all privacy methods, indicating that privacy-preserving transformations affect fundamental data characteristics rather than algorithm-specific features.

This consistency validates the experimental design and suggests that privacy method selection decisions can be made with confidence across different machine learning approaches. The high cross-model agreement also supports the use of any single model for initial privacy-utility assessment.

\subsection{Practical Implementation Insights}

\subsubsection{Platform Performance Characteristics}

The PPML platform demonstrated excellent computational efficiency across all experimental configurations. Dataset processing times remained under 2 seconds for all privacy methods, with memory usage stable at approximately 0.1 MB per dataset. The platform's ability to handle 30 experimental runs (10 datasets × 3 models) simultaneously without resource constraints validates its scalability for research applications.

Plugin-based architecture proved highly effective, enabling seamless integration of new privacy methods and machine learning algorithms. The comprehensive metric collection system (47 metrics per experiment) provided unprecedented analytical depth while maintaining user-friendly visualization and interpretation capabilities.

\subsubsection{Methodological Validation}

The experimental methodology successfully achieved comprehensive privacy-utility trade-off assessment through systematic parameter variation and multi-algorithm evaluation. The correlation analysis approach (ρ > 0.998 across primary metrics) validated the metric selection strategy and confirmed that simplified reporting maintains analytical rigor.

The platform's ability to extract model-specific internal diagnostics (Random Forest tree structure, linear model coefficients) provided crucial insights into why privacy-preserving transformations succeed or fail. This diagnostic capability distinguishes the platform from existing approaches that focus solely on external performance metrics.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

\subsubsection{Advanced Privacy Mechanisms}

The experimental results suggest several promising directions for advanced privacy mechanism development. The success of Laplace additive noise compared to Gaussian mechanisms indicates potential for alternative noise distribution exploration. The moderate success of uniform noise suggests that deterministic perturbation methods may provide acceptable privacy-utility trade-offs.

Hybrid approaches combining multiple privacy methods (e.g., k-Anonymity with minimal additive noise) represent promising research directions. The platform's modular architecture provides an ideal framework for exploring such combinations and quantifying their additive or synergistic effects.

\subsubsection{Enhanced Evaluation Methodologies}

Future platform enhancements should incorporate formal privacy risk assessment metrics to complement utility evaluation. The current focus on utility preservation, while valuable, provides incomplete privacy-utility trade-off assessment. Integration of re-identification risk measures, information-theoretic privacy metrics, and adversarial attack resistance would provide more comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

Scalability evaluation using higher-dimensional datasets and larger sample sizes would validate the platform's applicability to real-world scenarios. The current Iris dataset evaluation, while methodologically sound, may not capture the complexity of practical privacy-preserving machine learning applications.

\subsection{Conclusion and Research Contributions}
